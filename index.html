				<h1>Matthew Walinga | Software Developer</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Hey, I'm Matthew! I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo. In my free time I enjoy building cool projects, competing in chess competitions and playing the trumpet in concert band. Let's chat!</p>

						<span class="project-name">Double U </span><a href="https://github.com/walinga/Double-U">Github</a>
						<a href="https://repl.it/@MatthewWalinga/Double-U" target = "_blank">Try it Online</a>

					</div>
					<p>A non-deterministic programming language written in Ruby which allows the user to perform various statistical operations on large data sets. The language is command-based and includes a fully-working REPL for user convenience. Most of the commands have some component of randomization, which allows for a unique experience compared to other programming languages.</p>

						<span class="project-name">Chess AI </span><a href="https://github.com/walinga/Chess-Game">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A complex chess bot that uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning to decide on the best move. Written from scratch in python, this bot uses chess-based heuristics to augment the minimax backbone. The program can beat almost any casual player using the default settings. The UI features a captured-piece visual, as well as the ability to undo played moves.</p>

					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">ReadAR </span><a href="https://github.com/suoken/readAR">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A HackHarvard project which is designed to help children learn to read. The app provides the user with a story to read, and using Google's speech-to-text technology, it determines if the child is reading the text correctly. An AR component is also provided, which displays related face filters (eg. A dragon, a princess) to make the experience fun for children.</p>

					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">Quadris </span><a href="https://github.com/walinga/Quadris">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A Tetris-inspired game with the aim of clearing as many rows as possible. Built using C++ by me and two other friends, the game features a hint and an auto-saved high score. There are also 4 levels of increasing difficulty. It varies from classic Tetris due to the command-based gameplay, which allows the user to queue up several moves at once.</p>

					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">Rapatronics </span><a href="https://github.com/walinga/rapp">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>An Android app that suggests rhyming lines based on voice input from the user. The backend uses Google speech-to-text technology, as well as various natural language processing APIs. This app was a contender for QHacks 2017 and was made with the help of three other people.</p>
