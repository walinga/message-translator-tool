				<p>Hey, I'm Matthew! I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. When I'm not working on developing great software, you can find me playing chess or competing in programming challenges.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Chess AI</h2>
						<span>"Shallow Blue"</span>
						<span>&mdash;</span>
						<a href="https://github.com/walinga/Chess-Game">Github</a>
					<p>A complex chess bot that uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning to decide on the best move.
					Written from scratch in python, this project took about a month to get working and another month to optimize.
				    The program can beat almost any casual player using the default settings. The UI features a captured-piece visual, as well as a coloured box around the previous move played.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Tetris-like Game</h2>
						<span>"Quadris"</span>
						<span>&mdash;</span>
						<a href="https://github.com/walinga/Quadris">Github</a>
					<p>A tetris-inspired game with the aim of clearing as many rows as possible. Built using C++ by me and two other friends, the game features a hint and an auto-saved high score. There are also 4 levels of increasing difficulty. It varies from classic Tetris because of the command-based gameplay, which allows the user to queue up several moves at once.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Vote-based Social Network</h2>
						<span>"StreetRep"</span>
						<span>&mdash;</span>
						<a href="https://github.com/walinga/hack_the_north_2016_streetrep">Github</a>
					<p>A social network that allows users to post status updates at specific locations. Based on yik-yak, the site gives users a certain amount of cred based on upvotes and downvotes. This project was built at Hack the North 2016 using node.js, firebase, and bootstrap.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Automated Rap Assistant</h2>
						<span>"Rapatronics"</span>
						<span>&mdash;</span>
						<a href="https://github.com/walinga/hack_the_north_2016_streetrep">Github</a>
					<p>An Android app that suggests rhyming lines based on voice input from the user. The backend uses Google speech-to-text technology, as well as various natural language processing API's. This app was a contender for QHacks 2017 and was made with the help of three other people.</p>
