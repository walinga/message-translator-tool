				<p>Hey, I'm Matthew! I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. When I'm not working on developing great software, you can find me playing chess or competing in programming challenges.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Chess AI</h2>
					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">"Shallow Blue"</span> &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/walinga/Chess-Game">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A complex chess bot that uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning to decide on the best move. Written from scratch in python, this bot uses chess-based heuristics to augment the minimax backbone. The program can beat almost any casual player using the default settings. The UI features a captured-piece visual, as well as the ability to undo played moves.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Tetris-like Game</h2>
					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">"Quadris"</span> &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/walinga/Quadris">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A Tetris-inspired game with the aim of clearing as many rows as possible. Built using C++ by me and two other friends, the game features a hint and an auto-saved high score. There are also 4 levels of increasing difficulty. It varies from classic Tetris due to the command-based gameplay, which allows the user to queue up several moves at once.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Literacy Web App</h2>
					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">"ReadAR"</span> &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/suoken/readAR">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A HackHarvard project which is designed to help children learn to read. The app provides the user with a story to read, and using Google's speech-to-text technology, it determines if the child is reading the text correctly. An AR component is also provided, which displays related face filters (eg. A dragon, a princess) to make the experience fun for children.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Non-deterministic Programming Language</h2>
					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">"Double U"</span> &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/walinga/Double-U">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>A complete programming language written in Ruby which allows the user to perform various statistical operations on large data sets. The language is command-based and includes a fully-working REPL for user convenience. Most of the commands have some component of randomization, which allows for a unique experience compared to other programming languages.</p>

					<h2 class="project-title">Automated Rap Assistant</h2>
					<div class="project-desc">
						<span class="project-name">"Rapatronics"</span> &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/walinga/rapp">Github</a>
					</div>
					<p>An Android app that suggests rhyming lines based on voice input from the user. The backend uses Google speech-to-text technology, as well as various natural language processing APIs. This app was a contender for QHacks 2017 and was made with the help of three other people.</p>
